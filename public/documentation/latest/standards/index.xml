        <title>Standards</title>
        <paragraph>In this part of the workshop, we will introduce relevant standards and formats that are used throughout the workshop.
            As mentioned in <number_reference internal="True" refuri="../introduction/index#workshop-philosophy" title="Section %s"><inline classes="std std-numref">Section 1.2</inline></number_reference> we will cover a range of standards from various domains, and attempt to demonstrate how they can be linked together through the use of harmonised semantics (see, for example, <inline ids="id1">Neal <emphasis>et al.</emphasis> [<reference internal="True" reftitle="Maxwell Lewis Neal, Matthias König, David Nickerson, Göksel Mısırlı, Reza Kalbasi, Andreas Dräger, Koray Atalag, Vijayalakshmi Chelliah, Michael T.

        <paragraph>The hands-on tutorials will include specific options to help attendees gain familiarity with the standards, the tools for working with them, and the APIs and services that can be used to integrate them into your own tools and methods.</paragraph>

            <title>Coordinating standards development</title>
            <paragraph>When discussing standards in the context of this workshop, we primarily refer to community-based, grass-roots, standardisation efforts. Different communities have different approaches to developing, maintaining, and promoting their standards. The Computational Modelling in Biology Network (COMBINE, <reference refuri="https://co.mbine.org/">https://co.mbine.org/</reference>) was established to coordinate the development of the various community standards and formats for computational models (see <inline ids="id2">Waltemath <emphasis>et al.</emphasis> [<reference internal="True" reftitle="Dagmar Waltemath, Martin Golebiewski, Michael L. Blinov, Padraig Gleeson, Henning Hermjakob, Michael Hucka, Esther Thea Inau, Sarah M. Keating, Matthias König, Olga Krebs, Rahuman S. Malik-Sheriff, David Nickerson, Ernst Oberortner, Herbert M.

Standards accepted as core standards within the COMBINE community are expected to meet a minimal set of requirements in the management of the supporting community.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>COMBINE standards span several domains models and their use. This includes <reference name="CellML" refuri="https://cellml.org">CellML</reference><target ids="cellml" names="cellml" refuri="https://cellml.org"></target>, the <reference name="Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML)" refuri="https://sbml.org/">Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML)</reference><target ids="systems-biology-markup-language-sbml" names="systems\ biology\ markup\ language\ (sbml)" refuri="https://sbml.org/"></target>, and <reference name="NeuroML" refuri="https://neuroml.org/">NeuroML</reference><target ids="neuroml" names="neuroml" refuri="https://neuroml.org/"></target> for describing various types of models; and the <reference name="Simulation Experiment Description Markup Language (SED-ML)" refuri="https://sed-ml.org/">Simulation Experiment Description Markup Language (SED-ML)</reference><target ids="simulation-experiment-description-markup-language-sed-ml" names="simulation\ experiment\ description\ markup\ language\ (sed-ml)" refuri="https://sed-ml.org/"></target> for the use of models in numerical simulation experiments. There are also standards for graphical representation of models and standards for synthetic biology.</paragraph>

            <title>Standards aid model reuse</title>
            <paragraph>While sharing a model implementation in any way is significantly better than not sharing at all, unless a model is shared in a standard format it rapidly becomes inaccessible as software disappears or becomes unusable, requirements can no longer be met, etc. Sharing a model in a standard format ensures that it continues to be accessible - for example, models encoded in CellML or SBML 20 years ago can still be interpreted by current software tools even though the current tools did not exist at all 20 years ago. <inline ids="id3">Mendes [<reference internal="True" reftitle="Pedro Mendes.

            <paragraph>Furthermore, the modularity inherent in these standards enables parts of models to be reused. While tools and methods for the automated discovery and reuse of models and parts of models continue to themselves become more accessible (for example, see <inline ids="id4">[<reference internal="True" reftitle="Niloofar Shahidi, Michael Pan, Soroush Safaei, Kenneth Tran, Edmund J.
